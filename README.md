vanityURLs is a _simple_ solution to deploy a budget-friendly Url Shortener. It runs at scale in your Cloudflare subscription with continuous integration.

> If you don't own an a Cloudflare subscription already, you can create your free account today so you can experience everything without spending a dime.

Features:
 * Fully branded internet domain using Cloudflare [DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/application-services/products/dns/) & [Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
 * URL redirection as a 301 (e.g., moved permanently)
 * URL redirection as a 302 (e.g., moved temporarily)
 * Continuous integration managed by Cloudflare Page Engine

My objective is to drive it with a command line interface and fully automate it. So feel free to fork, and customize.

## What problem does it solve and why is it useful?

You’ve been there too, a fully branded short URLs are useful but your low volume does not justify a commercial solution. Furthermore, links generated by a free solution will eventually expire and they're not privacy friendly.

## How does it work?

1. Register a __tiny__ internet domain name with your [preferred vendor](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/products/registrar/)
2. Add the domain to [Cloudflare DNS](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
3. Store your URLs redirection list in a __private__ GitHub repository
4. Create a project underneath Cloudflare Workers & Pages
  *  [Connect the repository]https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/guide/#connect-your-git-provider-to-pages)
  * [Configure your deployment](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/guide/#configure-your-deployment)
  * Configure you build setup
    * Framework preset: none
    * Build command: none
    * Build output directory: /cfPage
  * Setup a [custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/custom-domains/) for your page project
  * Configure the DNS entry via [Cloudflare DNS](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)

### Can you elaborate about [URL redirection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Redirections#Overview) ?

YOu can learn more about [URL redirection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Redirections#Overview)
HTTP redirects are the best way to create redirections

The simplest way to redirect to another URL is to use an [HTML <meta>](https://www.w3docs.com/learn-html/html-meta-tag.html) tag with the http-equiv parameter set to “refresh”. The content attribute sets the delay before the browser redirects the user to the new web page. To redirect immediately, set this parameter to “0” seconds for the content attribute.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url='https://github.com/bhdicaire'" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>You will be redirected to BH Dicaire's Github soon!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

HTTP redirects always execute first — they exist when there is not even a transmitted page.
HTML redirects (<meta>) execute if there weren't any HTTP redirects.
JavaScript redirects execute last, and only if JavaScript is enabled.

A command line interface driven (CLI) Tiny URLs based on Cloudflare page.



## How to use?

The code is tested on OS X Ventura and you need only Node.js in the system to use [ Nano ID](https://github.com/ai/nanoid) to generate URL.

Make:
  * url --> Generate a unique ID for a new URL
  * edit --> Modify the URLs redirection list
  * build --> GIT add & commit the updated URLs redirection list AND push to github


## Install

The various configuration files are tested on OS X High Sierra (10.13). Older operating system versions may work — your mileage may vary, so download, review, and then execute the scripts.

Secure

 * `make url`
2.

```bash
/mail https://outlook.office.com/ 301

/github/* https://github.com/bhdicaire/:splat
```

## Everything you always wanted to know about URL redirection (but were afraid to ask)

HTTP is a [protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Resources_and_specifications) for fetching resources such as HTML documents. You can redirect at the service level, at the HTML page or via JavaScript if enabled.

The simplest way to redirect to another URL is to use an [HTML <meta>](https://www.w3docs.com/learn-html/html-meta-tag.html) tag with the http-equiv parameter set to “refresh”. The content attribute sets the delay before the browser redirects the user to the new web page. To redirect immediately, set this parameter to “0” seconds for the content attribute.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url='https://github.com/bhdicaire'" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>You will be redirected to BH Dicaire's Github soon!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

However HTTP redirects always execute first thus

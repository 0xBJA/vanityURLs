 * URL redirection as a 302 (e.g., moved temporarily)
  URL Redirect as a 301 Redirect
 * Continuous integration managed by Cloudflare Page Engine

## What problem does it solve and why is it useful?

You’ve been there too, fully branded short URLs are useful but the low volume does not justify a commercial solution. Furthermore, links generated by a free solution will eventually expire and they're not privacy friendly.

My objective is to drive it with a command line interface and fully automate it. So feel free to fork, and customize.

## How does it work?

1. Register a tiny internet domain name
2. Add the internet domain to Cloudflare DNS
3. Store your URLs redirection list in a private GitHub repository
4. Connect the repository to a project via [Cloudflare Page](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
  * Configure your deployment and build setup
  * Setup a custom domain for your page project
  * Configure the DNS entry via Cloudflare DNS

HTTP redirects are the best way to create redirections

The simplest way to redirect to another URL is to use an [HTML <meta>](https://www.w3docs.com/learn-html/html-meta-tag.html) tag with the http-equiv parameter set to “refresh”. The content attribute sets the delay before the browser redirects the user to the new web page. To redirect immediately, set this parameter to “0” seconds for the content attribute.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url='https://github.com/bhdicaire'" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>You will be redirected to BH Dicaire's Github soon!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

HTTP redirects always execute first — they exist when there is not even a transmitted page.
HTML redirects (<meta>) execute if there weren't any HTTP redirects.
JavaScript redirects execute last, and only if JavaScript is enabled.
